Graphene defect calculations
############################

This chapter contains recipes for various electronic calculations of graphene
nanoribbons.  It demonstrates some defect calculation with plot of PDOS and
wavefunctions.  These examples can be helpful in order to understand the first
application of transport calculations in chapter :ref:`sec-transport`.
