REKS
###################

This chapter discusses REKS (spin-Restricted Ensemble Kohn-Sham) calculations
for ground and low-lying excited states. This allows the calculation, for example,
of the state with multireference character as well as the vertical excitation
energies between the states. REKS can be classified as single-state REKS, SA-REKS,
and SI-SA-REKS.

In this chapter we will provide example calculations of basic energy and gradient
calculations, additional functionality such as level shifting and spin tuning,
and advanced calculations including nonadiabatic couplings between the states and
relaxed densities which can be used for QM/MM calculations. Finally, we will provide
helpful error handling methods when we use REKS calculations.
