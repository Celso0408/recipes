Analysing MD
************

MD simulations contain various information about the system. Fluctuations and
correlations in the ground state encode information about excitations
(fluctuation-dissipation theorem) and transport (Einstein relation and also the
Green-Kubo relations).

The velocity-velocity auto-correlation encodes the (anharmonic) vibrational
modes, while the dipole auto-correlation contains information on the mode
intensities. Both of these can be evaluated from the information  in `md.out` -
more information to follow.
