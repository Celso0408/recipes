Interfaces with other codes

In this section the methods for communication between DFTB+ and external
software is shown. This improves the ease of use and enables the user to invoke
DFTB+ via software they are more familiar with, such as the Atomic Simulation
Environment - ASE.

Furthermore, the interface communication offers the possibility of 
expanding the applications and functionality of DFTB+. For example, DFTB+ can 
serve as an energy/force engine, whereas an external driver is used for 
geometry optimization.
